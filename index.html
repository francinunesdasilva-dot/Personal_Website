      <p>Look up at the sky and notice how the clouds keep moving… After just a few seconds, they are no longer in the same place.</p>
      <p>Amid so many uncertainties, emptiness, and loneliness, everything is still in motion. Life is movement.</p>
      <p>No matter how misaligned things may seem, they are connected on an invisible plane. This movement is part of a greater journey we walk every moment.</p>
      <p>The secret of life lies in choosing what is right—what makes sense—while we are in motion.</p>
