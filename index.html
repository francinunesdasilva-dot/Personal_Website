  <!-- HERO -->

      <h1><span class="grad">Franciele Nunes Da Silva</span></h1>
      <p class="intro">
        I have lived a few very different lives in one. I am drawn to hard work and clean simplicity and also to depth,
        wonder, and the kind of learning that changes you. I navigate life with curiosity, reflection, and a deep
        appreciation for moments that reveal meaning. This space captures my journey, passions, and the inspirations
        that shape my world.

  <!-- WHO I AM -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Who I am</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I grew up in Minas Gerais, Brazil, on a farm where life was simple, grounded, and closely connected to nature.
      Surrounded by fresh food, animals, and open land, I learned early lessons about hard work, community, and responsibility.
      As I became more aware of the financial challenges of that life, I knew I wanted to build a different future for myself.
      At thirteen, I left the farm, began working full time, and continued school part time.
      After high school, I earned a full scholarship to study architecture but eventually realized my path lay elsewhere.
      In 2017, I moved to the United States with no English and little certainty.
      I shifted my focus to business to understand how ideas turn into real ventures and to prepare for an entrepreneurial life.
      After college, I gained experience on Wall Street, broadening my perspective on business and strategy.
      One principle has remained constant throughout it all: stay curious, ask questions, and give full care to whatever you choose to build.

  <!-- TRAVEL -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Travel</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I travel for perspective and to come back with a calmer mind. Every journey brings new perspectives,
      unforgettable encounters, and moments that feed creativity and reflection.
      Travel helps me connect with the world and with myself, and the experiences I collect become fuel for both my
      professional and personal life. I have visited only 12 countries, but I have spent a lot of time in the
      US national parks and I have visited 34 of them.

  <!-- PAINTINGS -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Paintings</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I started painting at a young age, paused for a long time, and recently resumed creating again.
      Painting is how I translate feelings, thoughts, and fleeting moments into color and form.
      Each piece is a fragment of my inner world expressed on canvas.

      I like to do creative writing. Nothing structured, no agenda, just free flow of thoughts.

  <!-- MEDITATION -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Meditation</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Meditation is training and a harder one. In today's world it is very challenging to sit quietly for a longer
      period of time and examine what is going on inside. In 2025, I completed an intensive 8-day silent retreat at a
      remote monastery. Removing the noise of digital life revealed clarity, resilience, and a quiet strength that I
      carry back into my day to day.

  <!-- READINGS & MOVIES -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Readings & Movies</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <p class="lead">
        I am very selective when it comes to books. I am drawn to psychology, philosophy, science, and biographies.
        Occasionally, a good novel makes its way into my list.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I started tracking the movies I watch in 2024, even though I have watched far more than what appears on my list.
        I love going to the movie theater and watching movies hot the press.
        All genres are welcome except for the really terrifying horror ones.

  <!-- FLOKI -->
  <section class="block">
    <h2 class="grad">Floki</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Floki is my constant companion and a source of joy in my life.
      He reminds me to slow down, enjoy the little moments, and approach each day with playfulness.
      He loves walks, but more importantly, he is a big fan of car rides.
