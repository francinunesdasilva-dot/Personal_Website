      <p class="kicker">Who I am</p>
      <h2><span class="grad">A life built in chapters</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I grew up in Minas Gerais, Brazil, on a farm where life was simple, grounded, and closely connected to nature. Surrounded by fresh food,
        animals, and open land, I had experiences that many people never do, and I learned early lessons about hard work, community, and responsibility.
        As I became more aware of the financial challenges of that life, I knew I wanted to build a different future for myself. At 13, I left the
        farm, began working full time, and continued school part time, learning independence earlier than most. After high school, I earned a full scholarship
        to study architecture but eventually realized my path lay elsewhere. In 2017, I moved to the United States, starting fresh with no English and little
        certainty. I shifted my focus to business to better understand how ideas turn into real ventures and to prepare for an entrepreneurial life. After college,
        I gained experience on Wall Street, which broadened my perspective on business and strategy. Throughout all these experiences, one principle has remained constant:
        stay curious, ask questions, and give your full care to whatever you choose to build.

      <h2><span class="grad">The outer world</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I travel for perspective and to come back with a calmer mind. Every journey brings new perspectives, unforgettable encounters, and moments that feed creativity
        and reflection. Travel helps me connect with the world and with myself, and the experiences I collect become fuel for both my professional and personal life.
        I have visited only 12 countries, but I have spent a lot of time in the U.S. national parks and I have visited 34 of them.

      <p class="lead">
        I started painting at a young age, paused for a very long time, and just recently resumed making a few pieces again.
        Painting is how I translate feelings, thoughts, and fleeting moments into color and form. Each piece is a story,
        a fragment of my inner world expressed on canvas.

          <h3>While Everything Moves</h3>
          <pre>Everything passes.
Look up at the sky and notice how the clouds keep moving…
After just a few seconds of watching them, they are no longer in the same place.

And inside, what is there?
Amid so many uncertainties, emptiness, and loneliness, everything is still in motion.
We may not yet know why, but movement is necessary.
Life is movement.

No matter how misaligned things may seem, they are, in truth, connected on an invisible plane.
Even if we don’t understand how, this movement was planned and is part of a greater journey;
a journey we are walking at every moment.

We don’t know where we are going, yet we continue forward, carried by movement itself.
What shapes our experience along the way are the choices we make.

The secret of life, then, lies in choosing what is right,
what makes sense, while we are in motion.</pre>

          <h3>Tomorrow</h3>
          <pre>I am running because I have a place to be 
A place that is magical and sweet
Where pain shall not exist
But colorful balloons, dance, and light

I am rushing to get to this place
As I need to live in it
If there is something so beautiful
How could one live a different life otherwise?

But there is a cost to get to this place
A price that few are willing to pay
And that is for not living in the present
And perhaps in constant pain

The place I long for is called tomorrow.
I will keep on chasing tomorrow
Even though I don't know
if it will exist</pre>

      <h2><span class="grad">Stillness</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Meditation entered my life through curiosity, as a way to turn inward and listen more closely to myself rather than the noise of the outside world.
        My practice is intuitive, centered on the breath and the simple act of observing thoughts as they arise and pass. While short practices were helpful,
        it was not until an 8-day silent retreat in a remote monastery that I experienced the deeper impact of meditation. Spending about 18 hours a day in
        silence and stillness allowed me to reconnect with my inner world in a way I had not before. The experience was deeply transformative, helping me
        connect more with myself, my intuition, and a sense of who I truly am. Since then, meditation has become a steady source of clarity and peace,
        keeping me grounded, present, and aligned amid the chaos of life.
